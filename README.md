# SOUNDS_4th_school_practical

Welcome to the SOUNDS 4th seasonal school practical session!

In this hands-on session, we will delve into the task of speech command classification using deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the practical session, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create and activate a conda environment

    conda create --name sounds4th python=3.10
    
    conda activate sounds4th

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    
    conda create --name sounds4th python==3.10 ipykernel notebook matplotlib tqdm scipy tensorboard

    conda activate sounds4th

    conda install conda-forge::'ffmpeg<7' python-sounddevice scikit-learn seaborn pandas

    conda install pytorch::pytorch torchaudio ignite -c pytorch

## Topics Covered

During this practical session, we will cover the following topics:

- Building a baseline model for speech command recognition
- Model training monitoring and evaluation
- Model improvement


Happy coding!
